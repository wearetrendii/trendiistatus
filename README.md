## How does it work?

This project uses Github actions to wake up every hour and run a shell script (`health-check.sh`). This script runs `curl` on every url in your config and appends the result of that run to a log file and commits it to the repository. This log is then pulled dynamically from `index.html` and displayed in a easily consumable fashion. You can also run that script from your own infrastructure to update the status page more often.
